Sqlite3Worker
=============

A threadsafe sqlite worker.

This library implements a thread pool pattern with sqlite3 being the
desired output.

sqllite3 implementation lacks the ability to safely modify the sqlite3
database with multiple threads outside of the compile time options. This
library was created to address this by bringing the responsibility of
managing the threads to the python layer and is agnostic to the server
setup of sqlite3.

Install
-------

You can use pip:

.. code:: sh

    sudo pip install sqlite3worker

You can use setup.py:

.. code:: sh

    sudo python setup.py install

Alternatively one can use ``pip`` to install directly from the git
repository without having to clone first:

.. code:: sh

    sudo pip install git+https://github.com/dashawn888/sqlite3worker#egg=sqlite3worker

One may also use ``pip`` to install on a per-user basis without
requiring super-user permissions:

.. code:: sh

    pip install --user git+https://github.com/dashawn888/sqlite3worker#egg=sqlite3worker

Example
-------

.. code:: python

    from sqlite3worker import Sqlite3Worker

    sql_worker = Sqlite3Worker("/tmp/test.sqlite")
    sql_worker.execute("CREATE TABLE tester (timestamp DATETIME, uuid TEXT)")
    sql_worker.execute("INSERT into tester values (?, ?)", ("2010-01-01 13:00:00", "bow"))
    sql_worker.execute("INSERT into tester values (?, ?)", ("2011-02-02 14:14:14", "dog"))

    results = sql_worker.execute("SELECT * from tester")
    for timestamp, uuid in results:
        print(timestamp, uuid)

    sql_worker.close()

When to use sqlite3worker
-------------------------

If you have multiple threads all needing to write to a sqlite3 database
this library will serialize the sqlite3 write requests.

When NOT to use sqlite3worker
-----------------------------

If your code DOES NOT use multiple threads then you don't need to use a
thread safe sqlite3 implementation.

If you need multiple applications to write to a sqlite3 db then
sqlite3worker will not protect you from corrupting the data.

Internals
---------

The library creates a queue to manage multiple queries sent to the
database. Instead of directly calling the sqlite3 interface, you will
call the Sqlite3Worker which inserts your query into a Queue.Queue()
object. The queries are processed in the order that they are inserted
into the queue (first in, first out). In order to ensure that the
multiple threads are managed in the same queue, you will need to pass
the same Sqlite3Worker object to each thread.
